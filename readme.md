Make a simple api for a todo-list aplication:
The api should allow to:

- fetch all todos from a database
- fetch a single todo by its id from database
- create a new todo and save it to database
- update a todo and save it to database

You can `cd` into the `public` dir and run `php -S localhost:1234`
to start the app.

You can use `postman chrome application` to test your api
